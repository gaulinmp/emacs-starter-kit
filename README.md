## Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences

A drop-in starter-kit for Emacs 24, derived from [Kieran Healy's](https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit), [Phil Hagelberg's](https://github.com/technomancy) and [Eric Schulte's](https://github.com/eschulte/) originals, but now somewhat different from those. Designed for social scientists researching and writing in plain text using some combination of LaTeX, R, SAS, STATA, Python, Haskell, Git, Markdown, and Org-Mode.

For installation instructions, see the [Social Science Starter Kit page](http://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit.html).

Or simply clone to desktop and drop into `~/.emacs.d/`.

Note: Kieran Healy's Starter Kit assumes you are using Aquamacs. I prefer the Mac Port from [Yamamoto Mitsuharu](https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port) which is closer to the UNIX Emacs, less buggy, and has SVG and Unicode support.
