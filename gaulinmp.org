This file contains very local customizations---ones that in some cases
you will not be able to just drop in and use because, e.g., they
involve references to particular files on my own machine. It's
included here for completeness, and as and example of the kind of
things you might put in your own user-specific file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun unix-file ()
    "Change the current buffer to Latin 1 with Unix line-ends."
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'iso-latin-1-unix t))
  (defun dos-file ()
    "Change the current buffer to Latin 1 with DOS line-ends."
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'iso-latin-1-dos t))

    "Change the current buffer to Latin 1 with Mac line-ends."
